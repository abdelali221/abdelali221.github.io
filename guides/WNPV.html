    <h1>WNPV</h1>
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>WNPV stands for Wii Network Profiles Viewer, it's a homebrew app that allows you to see & edit your Wii's network <br> 
      profiles just like in the Wii settings with better control over what is enabled or not.<br>
      The app comes with a simple Text User Interface (TUI for short), so the app is lightweight and <br>
      doesn't take more than half a megabyte in your storage device.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section class="header" id="Start&Reading">
    <h2>Section 1 : Reading the Profiles infos</h2>
    <p>Upon starting the app, you'll get greeted with this screen :
    <br><br><img src="startscreen.jpg">
    <br><br>Press PLUS to proceed. After that you'll see the path & size of the config file.
    <br><br>You should now see something like this :
    <br><br><img src="profile.jpg">
    <br><br>This shows all the profile infos, you can press left or right on the D-PAD
    <br>to switch between the different profiles.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="header" id="Dump&Test">
    <section id="Dump">
      <h2>Section 2 : Dumping & Testing the configuration</h2>
      <h3>Section 2.1 : Dumping</h3>
      <p>The app gives you the ability to dump the config.dat to your SD card incase something happens,
        <br>or to analyse it on your computer if you're a dev for example.
        <br><br>In order to dump the file, simply press ONE while on this screen :
        <br><br><img src="profile.jpg">
        <br><br>If the dump is successful, you'll see this :
        <br><br><img src="dumpsuccess.jpg">
        <br><br>If nothing happens, it means that the dump didn't occur.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Test">
      <h3>Section 2.2 : Testing</h3>
      <p>You can test the connectivity between the Wii and your router
        <br>by pressing PLUS while being on this screen :
        <br><br><img src="profile.jpg">
        <br><br>After pressing PLUS you should see this :
        <br><br><img src="testsuccess.jpg">
        <br><br>If instead the test fails it means that there's an
        <br>issue with the configuration.
      </p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section class="header" id="Editing">
    <h2>Section 3 : Editing Profiles</h2>
    <p>Before editing, select the desired profile, then press TWO to enter edit mode :
    <br><br><img src="editprofile0.jpg">
    <br><br>You will see like above an arrow pointing to the first setting,
    <br>you can press A to toggle it :
    <br><br><img src="editprofile1.jpg">
    <br><br>Some options have a <img src="plusarrow.jpg"> before them, 
    <br>that means that there's a submenu for those options.
    <br><br>Submenus can contain three types of settings; Numerical, String or
    <br>Address.
    </p>

    <section id="Editing-Num">
      <h3>Section 3.1 : Editing A Numerical Setting</h3>
      <p>Let's start by editing the Proxy port :
      <br><br><img src="proxy0.jpg">
      <br><br>If you press A, a Numpad will show up on the screen :
      <br><br><img src="proxy1.jpg">
      <br><br>By aiming at it with the Wii Remote, you can write a numerical value
      <br>(In this case it's the Port, which has to be between 0 & 34463).
    </section>

    <section id="Editing-Str">
      <h3>Section 3.2 : Editing A String-type Setting</h3>
      <p>We'll select the Proxy Server setting :
      <br><br><img src="proxy2.jpg">
      <br><br>If you press A, a keyboard will show up on the screen :
      <br><br><img src="proxy3.jpg">
      <br><br>By aiming at it with the Wii Remote, you can write a string
      <br>(In this case it's the Proxy Server).
    </section>

    <section id="Editing-Addr">
      <h3>Section 3.3 : Editing An Address-type Setting</h3>
      <p>When opening the IP or DNS submenu you get something like this :
      <br><br><img src="DNS0.jpg">
      <br><br>If you press A on any of the options, a Numpad will show up on the screen :
      <br><br><img src="DNS1.jpg">
      <br><br>Similarly to the Numerical setting, you aim at the Numpad to write,
      <br>but each option has four values to configure.
      <br>When you're done changing the first value, you move to the next by pressing on the
      <br>dot character (The app automatically does that if the next digit makes it bigger than 255).

  <section class="header" id="APScan">
    <h2>Section 4 : Scanning for WiFi APs</h2>
    <p>WNPV is the first Wii homebrew that supports WiFi scanning (wdexample doesn't count lol),
      <br>which means that you can configure network profiles just like in the Wii Menu.
      <br><br>In order to do so, you first have to select the desired
      <br>profile & enter editing mode :
      <br><br><img src="editprofile0.jpg">
      <br><br>Then press 2 to initiate a Scan :
      <br><br><img src="APScan0.jpg">
      <br><br>After a couple of seconds you'll see a list of access points (If there are any nearby),
      <br>choose the one you want to connect to :
      <br><br><img src="APScan1.jpg">
      <br><br>If the AP is secured (with WPA/WPA2 or WEP),
      <br>you will be prompted to enter the WiFi password.
      <br><br>Note : If the AP is secured with WPA/WPA2, make sure that the password is at least
      <br>8 characters long, and if the security is WEP then your password will be either 5
      <br>or 13 characters long.
      <br>If you fail to enter the correct length, the app will automatically switch the security
      <br>to open so you can set it properly in the WiFi settings submenu.
